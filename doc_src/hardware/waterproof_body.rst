.. tip::

    If you are just beginning development we recommend that you start by placing all the parts of the DIVE COMPUTER in the printed version of the enclosure. This is cheap and will help you avoid assembly problems. The parts can be slightly larger or smaller. You may simply have wires and connections that are too long. We strongly recommend using 3D printing before final assembly.
