# Warning
WARNING! THERE IS ALWAYS A RISK OF DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS (DCS) FOR ANY DIVE PROFILE EVEN IF YOU FOLLOW THE DIVE PLAN PRESCRIBED BY DIVE TABLES. NO PROCEDURE OR DIVE TABLE WILL PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF DCS OR OXYGEN TOXICITY! An individualâ€™s physiological make up can vary from day to day. You are strongly advised to remain well within the exposure limits provided by the planner to minimize the risk of DCS.

Please note - this program is made with the experienced and technical diver in mind. If you're relatively new to diving, you may find this program difficult to use. You're expected to know the theory behind the diving practices and procedures used here.
